This is sir slime's crazy adventure, a brick-breaker game where you have to hit and remove all the blocks with a slime by moving a wooden platform left and right.

How to play:
You start by pressing space and move left/right with the arrow keys or a & d.
When all blocks have been removed, the player can choose between 3 upgrades (common = white, rare = blue, legendary = yellow) and a new level gets generated. The block's hp and amount of blocks scale with level and higher levels introduce new blocks with even higher hp.
If the ball falls below the bottom boundary, the player loses a life. If all lives have been lost, the player loses.
The ball slowly gains speed when playing and the speed gets reset when the player clears the level or loses a life.

How to run:
Run the following command in the terminal: java -jar YOURPATH\AdvancedBreakout2ig.jar

Requirements:
Java and JavaFX installed
